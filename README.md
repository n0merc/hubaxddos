##  Configuration
Edit the constants at the top of `hubaxddos.py`:
```python
MAX_THREADS = 1000      # Maximum concurrent threads
PACKET_SIZE = 4096      # Size of each packet
TIMEOUT = 3             # Socket timeout in seconds
ATTACK_DURATION = 300   # Default attack duration
```

##  Statistics
The tool provides real-time statistics including:
- Target information
- Attack duration
- Packets sent
- Bytes transferred
- Packets per second
- Current status
