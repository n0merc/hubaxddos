# HUBaxDDOS v2.0 - Maximum Power Network Stress Testing Tool

HUBaxDDOS is a powerful, Python-based network security tool designed for stress testing and analyzing network resilience. This version is specifically optimized to bypass common protections like Cloudflare and handle HTTPS (SSL) targets using high-speed multi-threading and IP spoofing techniques.

##  Key Features

* **MAX HTTPS/SSL Flood:** Performs high-frequency GET requests over Port 443 with full SSL/TLS handshake support.
* **IP Spoofing:** Randomizes `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` headers to mask the origin IP and mimic traffic from multiple global sources.
* **User-Agent Rotation:** Automatically switches between various modern browser strings (Chrome, Safari, iOS) to avoid signature-based detection.
* **Keep-Alive Pipelining:** Sends multiple requests through a single persistent connection to maximize Requests Per Second (RPS).
* **UDP Flood:** Floods targets with large, randomized packets to test bandwidth capacity.
* **Real-time Statistics:** Track the total number of packets/requests sent during an active session.

## 🛠 Installation

1.  Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

##  Usage

Run the tool using the following command:
```bash
python3 hubaxddos.py
Commands:
https: Launch a high-power HTTPS attack (Optimized for websites).

udp: Launch a UDP packet flood (Optimized for IP/Port stress).

stats: View current session statistics.

stop: Kill all active attack threads.

exit: Close the application.

 Optimization (Linux/Mac)
To handle thousands of concurrent threads and avoid "Too many open files" errors, increase your system's descriptor limit before running the script:

Bash

ulimit -n 100000
